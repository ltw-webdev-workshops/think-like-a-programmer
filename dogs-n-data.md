      ## What & why

      We’re going to explore creating data structures that are common to programming—by describing dogs.

      Often information needs to be structured with a limited set of data types.

      **Data structuring is critical to understanding configuration and program information storage.**

      ## Data structures

      - `string` — just some text
      - `number` — just a number
      - `boolean` — `true` or `false`
      - `array` — a collection, like `<ol>`
      - `object` — a named collection, like `<dl>`

      ## Simple example

      ```
      name: Paddington
      size: Small
      weight: 5
      colours:
        - Brown
        - Black
        - White
      ```

      ## Set up

      1. Form into pairs
      2. Get assigned a dog
      3. Get a pencil & a piece of paper
      4. Describe the dog’s attributes using data structures
        <br>**In a way that would work for every dog**
      5. Present the structure so we can build a specification
